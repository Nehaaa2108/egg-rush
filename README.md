# 🥚 Egg Rush – Adaptive Difficulty Game

Egg Rush is a browser-based arcade game where players catch falling eggs using a basket.
What makes this game unique is its **AI-inspired adaptive difficulty system** that adjusts gameplay in real time based on player performance.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- Chickens drop eggs from above
- Move the basket to catch eggs
- Different egg types:
  - 🥚 Normal Egg → +1 point
  - 🌟 Golden Egg → +5 points
  - 💀 Rotten Egg → −2 points
- Missing normal eggs reduces lives (Classic mode)

## 🧠 Adaptive Difficulty (Game AI Feature)

This game includes a **dynamic difficulty adjustment system** inspired by game AI principles.

The game continuously tracks:
- Eggs caught
- Eggs missed
- Accuracy
- Current streak

Based on player performance:
- High accuracy → egg spawn speed increases (harder)
- Low accuracy → difficulty eases to help recovery
- Emergency easing prevents unfair difficulty spikes

This creates a **personalized experience for every playthrough**.

> No machine learning model is used — instead, real-time player behavior analytics and rule-based adaptive logic are applied (a common approach in commercial games).
